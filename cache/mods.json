If it is set, the user is automatically forced into that anchor. If several anchors are set, a random one is selected, unless the user is already in one of the anchors. (#42)\r\n- Added new restriction `Maximum Voice Mode`. It requires a dynamic variable of type `VoiceMode`. We are also deprecating the restriction `Enforce Whispering`. Use this new restriction instead, with voice mode set to whispering. (#109 #110)\r\n\r\nAlso some of the changes of the splittening branch were merged. If you want to try out Restrainite with the pre-release (splittening) version of Resonite, use the pre-release versions [v2.0.x](https://github.com/Restrainite/Restrainite/releases).\r\n\r\n# Bugfix:\r\n- Fix `Always Hear Selected Users`\r\n- Fix crash with `Prevent Leaving Anchors`, when a local user was forced to swap between anchors.\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/Restrainite/Restrainite/compare/v1.2.9...v1.3.6",

This has been replaced by using `Always Hear Selected Users` and `Prevent Hearing Of Users` together. The decision was made, because it behaves slightly different. If a user is allowed by `Enforce Selective Hearing`,  they can still be muted by other restrictions, meanwhile with `Always Hear Selected Users`, the user can always be heard.\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes\r\n- Fix `PreventLaserTouch` in VR: If the laser was still pointing at an object, while this was toggled, that object was still touchable. #100\r\n- Change Harmony ID to match GitHub Name\r\n- Remove debug line spamming `Updating variable`\r\n\r\n# Known Bugs:\r\n - `Always Hear Selected Users` is broken.

Setting the float value to 0.0 means no movement. Uses SmoothLerp internally. #65\r\n- `Disable Vr Trackers`: If the user is in VR, disable all trackers and make the avatar behave like Desktop mode. #94\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/Restrainite/RestrainiteMod/compare/v1.1.8...v1.2.0",
