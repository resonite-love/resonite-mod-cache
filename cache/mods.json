We've completely changed how restrictions are structured internally to make them easier to extend in the future. This made it easier to implement the following new features:\r\n\r\n## New Features:\r\n\r\n- Added optional `Chirality?` dynamic variable to the following restrictions: (#99, #112, #114)\r\n  - `Prevent Climbing`\r\n  - `Prevent Grabbing`\r\n  - `Prevent Laser Touch`\r\n  - `Prevent Opening Context Menu`\r\n  - `Maximum Laser Distance`\r\n  - `Prevent Physical Touch`\r\n  - `Prevent Using Tools`\r\n- Added optional `AvatarAnchor` dynamic reference variable to `Prevent Leaving Anchors`. If it is set, the user is automatically forced into that anchor. If several anchors are set, a random one is selected, unless the user is already in one of the anchors. (#42)\r\n- Added new restriction `Maximum Voice Mode`. It requires a dynamic variable of type `VoiceMode`. We are also deprecating the restriction `Enforce Whispering`. Use this new restriction instead, with voice mode set to whispering. (#109 #110)\r\n\r\nAlso some of the changes of the splittening branch were merged. If you want to try out Restrainite with the pre-release (splittening) version of Resonite, use the pre-release versions [v2.0.x](https://github.com/Restrainite/Restrainite/releases).\r\n\r\n# Bugfix:\r\n- Fix `Always Hear Selected Users`\r\n- Fix crash with `Prevent Leaving Anchors`, when a local user was forced to swap between anchors.\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/Restrainite/Restrainite/compare/v1.2.9...v1.3.6",

If it is set, the user is automatically forced into that anchor. If several anchors are set, a random one is selected, unless the user is already in one of the anchors. (#42)\r\n- Added new restriction `Maximum Voice Mode`. It requires a dynamic variable of type `VoiceMode`. We are also deprecating the restriction `Enforce Whispering`. Use this new restriction instead, with voice mode set to whispering.

This has been replaced by using `Always Hear Selected Users` and `Prevent Hearing Of Users` together. The decision was made, because it behaves slightly different. If a user is allowed by `Enforce Selective Hearing`,  they can still be muted by other restrictions, meanwhile with `Always Hear Selected Users`, the user can always be heard.\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes\r\n- Fix `PreventLaserTouch` in VR: If the laser was still pointing at an object, while this was toggled, that object was still touchable. #100\r\n- Change Harmony ID to match GitHub Name\r\n- Remove debug line spamming `Updating variable`\r\n\r\n# Known Bugs:\r\n - `Always Hear Selected Users` is broken.

        "changelog": "# IMPORTANT INFO\r\n\r\nIn our current runtime (Unity mono 5.11), CherryPick seems to exacerbate certain innocuous usages of reflection, causing slowdowns in seemingly unrelated parts of the game due to the fact that it needs to look up all valid FrooxEngine component names via methods that use reflection.\r\n\r\nIt is **highly** recommended (though not required) that you also grab [Effortless Efficiency](https://github.com/BlueCyro/EffortlessEfficiency/releases/tag/1.0.0) to install alongside CherryPick, as it will alleviate some issues with the runtime such as Animator components hitching when switching their clips. Install Effortless Efficiency if you experience any weird performance issues.\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nWith that out of the way, I've optimized the search method for CherryPick by de-LinQ-ifying much of the search loop. Searching should be far more performant. I've also changed the method by which the component list is looked up and cached, which should solve the slowdowns in other parts of the game too (contacts list, inventory, some other stuff that utilizes reflection, etc.) and so your games should feel much snappier.\r\n\r\nI strive to make my mods as non-invasive and as light as possible, so I deeply apologize if you've been noticing performance slowdowns with my mod installed. Seeing the popularity CherryPick has gained warms my heart, and so hopefully these few things make up for that. ❤️\r\n\r\n# Changelog\r\n\r\n- Improved search method speed significantly by removing LinQ from hot parts of the search code\r\n    - The searching should be more efficient and feel snappier overall\r\n- Changed method for building the component cache, avoiding significant slowdowns in other parts of the engine - solves issue #17 \r\n- Provided link to [Effortless Efficiency](https://github.com/BlueCyro/EffortlessEfficiency/releases/tag/1.0.0) - solves issue #10\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",

Keep in mind that only the host of the session requires the mod for everyone to benefit. This is **not** required by other clients, won't do anything in sessions you don't own.\r\n\r\nAlso we're going back to 3-place version numbers since 4 isn't compatible with the mod manifest - you'll find it on there soon™™\r\n\r\nAnyways,\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
