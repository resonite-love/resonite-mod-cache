This has been replaced by using `Always Hear Selected Users` and `Prevent Hearing Of Users` together. The decision was made, because it behaves slightly different. If a user is allowed by `Enforce Selective Hearing`,  they can still be muted by other restrictions, meanwhile with `Always Hear Selected Users`, the user can always be heard.\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes\r\n- Fix `PreventLaserTouch` in VR: If the laser was still pointing at an object, while this was toggled, that object was still touchable. #100\r\n- Change Harmony ID to match GitHub Name\r\n- Remove debug line spamming `Updating variable`\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/Restrainite/Restrainite/compare/v1.2.0...v1.2.3",

No code changes need to be made, but dependencies of this method **MUST** be recompiled.\r\n\r\nPer #1294, `EmbedBuilder.WithAuthor` must use the `IUser` overload. Behaviorally, this acts similarly, except that nicknames will not be displayed. Dependencies of this method **MUST** be recompiled.\r\n\r\nPer 03e6401, when a bulk delete event is received, the client will log a warning, and raise the `MessageDeleted` event for all messages in the bulk delete, as well as the `MessagesBulkDeleted` event. To suppress this warning, the client should be configured with the `ExclusiveBulkDelete` set.\r\n```cs\r\nvar client = new DiscordSocketClient(new DiscordSocketConfig {\r\n    ExclusiveBulkDelete = false // raise both events\r\n    // OR\r\n    ExclusiveBulkDelete = true // raise only MessagesBulkDeleted\r\n});\r\n``` \r\n\r\n### Added\r\n- #1236: Bulk deletes (for messages) may now be accessed via the `MessagesBulkDeleted` event (dec353e)\r\n- #1240: OAuth applications utilizing the `guilds.join` scope may now add users to guilds through any client (1356ea9)\r\n- #1255: Message and attachment spoilers may now be set or detected (f3b20b2)\r\n- #1260: DiscordWebhookClient may be created from a Webhook URL (f2113c7)\r\n- #1261: A `GetCategoryChannel` helper may now be used to retrieve category channels directly from socket guilds (e03c527)\r\n- #1263: \"user joined the guild\" messages are now supported (00d3f5a)\r\n- #1271: AuthorID may now be retrieved from message delete audit log entries (1ae4220)\r\n- #1293: News Channels are now supported 📰 (9084c42)\r\n- `ExclusiveBulkDelete` configuration setting can be used to control bulk delete event behavior (03e6401)\r\n\r\n### Removed\r\n- #1294: The `IGuildUser` overload of `EmbedBuilder.WithAuthor` no longer exists (b52b54d)\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n- #1256: Fetching audit logs no longer raises null reference exceptions when a webhook has been deleted (049b014) \r\n- #1268: Null reference exceptions on `MESSAGE_CREATE` concerning partial member objects no longer occur (377622b)\r\n- #1278: The token validator now internally pads tokens to the proper length (48b327b)\r\n- #1292: Messages now properly initialize empty collections (b2ebc03)\r\n- The `DiscordSocketRestClient` is now properly initialized (a44c13a)\r\n- Exceptions in event handlers are now always logged (f6e3200)\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n- #1305: Token validation will fail when tokens contain whitespace (bb61efa)\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n- #1241: Added documentation samples for Webhooks (655a006)\r\n- #1243: Happy new year 🎉 (0275f7d)\r\n- #1257: Improved clarity in comments in the command samples (2473619)\r\n- #1276: Documentation uses a relative path for the logo asset (b80f0e8)\r\n- #1303: EmbedBuilder documentation now builds in the correct spot (51618e6)\r\n- #1304: Updated documentation (4309550)\r\n- CI for this project is now powered by Azure DevOps (this is not a sponsored message 🚀) (9b2bc18)\r\n- IDisposableAnalyzers should now be a development dependency (8003ac8)",

For unicode emojis, you should use the `Emoji` class; for guild emotes, either parse the emote via `Emote.Parse` or fetch it from the guild.\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nIEmote emote = new Emoji(\"\\U0001f603\");\r\n// or:\r\nIEmote emote = Emote.Parse(\"<:fox_moose:381914721642872843>\");\r\n\r\nvar reactions = await msg.GetReactionUsersAsync(emote);\r\n```\r\n\r\nPer #744, IAsyncEnumerable can be flattened into a single, non-paginated Async collection via `IAsyncEnumerable#Flatten`, or can be flattened into a single IEnumerable via `FlattenAsync`. All existing code should be moved from `await coll.Flatten();` -> `await coll.FlattenAsync();`\r\n\r\nPer #790, `EmbedBuilder.AddInlineField` has been removed. You should instead use `AddField(inline: true)`\r\n\r\nPer #801, all EmbedBuilders must be built prior to use in a message. All existing code should append the build method: `await ReplyAsync(\"\", embed: embed`**`.Build()`**`)`\r\n\r\nPer #804, the overridden signatures of your commands attributes will need to be refactored:\r\n- `PreconditionAttribute#CheckPermissions` -> `PreconditionAttribute#CheckPermissionsAsync`\r\n- `TypeReader#Read` -> `TypeReader#ReadAsync`\r\n\r\nPer #829, you will need to ensure that you are in an `ITextChannel` when attempting to bulk delete or access the NSFW property:\r\n```cs\r\nif (channel is ITextChannel text)\r\n{\r\n    await text.DeleteMessagesAsync();\r\n    var nsfw = text.Nsfw;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPer #874, you should replace all accesses to `(Guild|Channel)Permission.ReadMessages` with `ViewChannel`\r\n\r\nPer #877, Games have been refactored and made more polymorphic.\r\n- `IGuildUser#Game` -> `IGuildUser#Activity`\r\n- `StreamType` -> `ActivityType`\r\n- `StreamType.NotStreaming` -> `ActivityType.Playing`\r\n- `StreamType.Twitch` -> `ActivityType.Streaming`\r\n- Activities only include the name of the game and the ActivityType.\r\n- Activities are a type of `Game`, `StreamingGame`, or `RichGame` - you may want to use a pattern match.\r\n\r\nPer #955, the `GameParty` class now uses `long` instead of `int`. Update your domain objects accordingly, if you need to.\r\n\r\nPer #958, **user tokens are no longer supported**. Discord disallows and discourages their usage, so we suggest you bring your selfbot-based projects to an end, or find another Discord library which still supports user token login.\r\n\r\nPer #1033, references to `ReadMessages` should be changed to `ViewChannel`. This applies to the guild and channel permissions enums, as well as the permissions sets.\r\n\t\r\nPer #1057, `IAudioChannel#ConnectAsync` was changed from one parameter to three parameters.\r\n\r\nPer #1164, the `CommandExecuted` event has changed signature. You may need to update your event handlers.\r\n\r\nPer #1171, all client types now implement `IDisposable`. You may need to update your own objects to match this change.\r\n\r\nPer #1172, invite related methods were moved from `IGuildChannel` to `INestedChannel`. You may need to replace these channel accesses with casts to nested channels first.\r\n\r\nPer #1196, `CreateCategoryAsync` now takes a properties function before the request options. If you were specifying request options without using a named parameter before, this will need to be updated.\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n- #747: `CommandService` now has a `CommandExecuted` event

        "changelog": "This is a beta release of the next major version. Changes have been made to fix previous design errors, as well as add additional functionality per the Discord API. \r\n\r\nThanks to the following for their contributions this release:\r\n\r\n- @alanschapira \r\n- @AntiTcb \r\n- @BinkanSalaryman \r\n- @Chris-Johnston \r\n- @Emzi0767 \r\n- @enzosk8 \r\n- @FiniteReality \r\n- @Izumemori \r\n- @Joe4evr \r\n- @MarkusGordathian \r\n- @ObsidianMinor \r\n- @Still34 \r\n- @SubZero0 \r\n- @vim2meta \r\n- @Vollrat \r\n\r\n### Upgrade Path\r\n\r\nPer #731, a correct implementation of `IEmote` must be used when accessing reaction users. For unicode emojis, you should use the `Emoji` class; for guild emotes, either parse the emote via `Emote.Parse` or fetch it from the guild.\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nIEmote emote = new Emoji(\"\\U0001f603\");\r\n// or:\r\nIEmote emote = Emote.Parse(\"<:fox_moose:381914721642872843>\");\r\n\r\nvar reactions = await msg.GetReactionUsersAsync(emote);\r\n```\r\n\r\nPer #744, IAsyncEnumerable can be flattened into a single, non-paginated Async collection via `IAsyncEnumerable#Flatten`, or can be flattened into a single IEnumerable via `FlattenAsync`. All existing code should be moved from `await coll.Flatten();` -> `await coll.FlattenAsync();`\r\n\r\nPer #790, `EmbedBuilder.AddInlineField` has been removed. You should instead use `AddField(inline: true)`\r\n\r\nPer #801, all EmbedBuilders must be built prior to use in a message. All existing code should append the build method: `await ReplyAsync(\"\", embed: embed`**`.Build()`**`)`\r\n\r\nPer #804, the overridden signatures of your commands attributes will need to be refactored:\r\n- `PreconditionAttribute#CheckPermissions` -> `PreconditionAttribute#CheckPermissionsAsync`\r\n- `TypeReader#Read` -> `TypeReader#ReadAsync`\r\n\r\nPer #829, you will need to ensure that you are in an `ITextChannel` when attempting to bulk delete or access the NSFW property:\r\n```cs\r\nif (channel is ITextChannel text)\r\n{\r\n    await text.DeleteMessagesAsync();\r\n    var nsfw = text.Nsfw;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPer #874, you should replace all accesses to `(Guild|Channel)Permission.ReadMessages` with `ViewChannel`\r\n\r\nPer #877, Games have been refactored and made more polymorphic.\r\n- `IGuildUser#Game` -> `IGuildUser#Activity`\r\n- `StreamType` -> `ActivityType`\r\n- `StreamType.NotStreaming` -> `ActivityType.Playing`\r\n- `StreamType.Twitch` -> `ActivityType.Streaming`\r\n- Activities only include the name of the game and the ActivityType.\r\n- Activities are a type of `Game`, `StreamingGame`, or `RichGame` - you may want to use a pattern match.\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\n- #747: `CommandService` now has a `CommandExecuted` event (e991715)\r\n- #765: Parameters may have a name specified via `NameAttribute` (9c81ab9)\r\n- #773: Both socket clients inherit from `BaseSocketClient` (9b7afec)\r\n- #785: Primitives now automatically load a NullableTypeReader (cb0ff78)\r\n- #819: Support for Welcome Message channels (30e867a)\r\n- #835: Emoji may now be managed from a bot (b4bf046)\r\n- #843: Webhooks may now be managed from a bot (7b2ddd0)\r\n- #863: An embed may be converted to an `EmbedBuilder` using the `.ToEmbedBuilder()` method (5218e6b)\r\n- #877: Support for reading rich presences (34b4e5a)\r\n- #888: Users may now opt-in to using a proxy (678a723)\r\n- #906: API Analyzers to assist users when writing their bot (f69ef2a)\r\n- #907: Full support for channel categories (030422f)\r\n- #913: Animated emoji may be read and written (a19ff18)\r\n- #915: Unused parameters may be discarded, rather than failing the command (5f46aef)\r\n- #929: Standard EqualityComparers for use in LINQ operations with the library's entities (b5e7548)\r\n- 'html' variant added to the `EmbedType` enum (42c879c)\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n- #742: `DiscordShardedClient#GetGuildFor` will now direct null guilds to Shard 0 (d5e9d6f)\r\n- #743: Various issues with permissions and inheritance of permissions (f996338)\r\n- #755: `IRole.Mention` will correctly tag the @everyone role (6b5a6e7)\r\n- #768: `CreateGuildAsync` will include the icon stream (865080a)\r\n- #866: Revised permissions constants and behavior (dec7cb2)\r\n- #872: Bulk message deletion should no longer fail for incomplete batch sizes (804d918)\r\n- #923: A null value should properly reset a user's nickname (227f61a)\r\n- #938: The reconnect handler should no longer deadlock during Discord outages (73ac9d7)\r\n- Ignore messages with no ID in bulk delete (676be40)\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n- #731: `IUserMessage#GetReactionUsersAsync` now takes an `IEmote` instead of a `string` (5d7f2fc)\r\n- #744: IAsyncEnumerable has been redesigned (5bbd9bb)\r\n- #777: `IGuild#DefaultChannel` will now resolve the first accessible channel, per changes to Discord (1ffcd4b)\r\n- #781: Attempting to add or remove a member's EveryoneRole will throw (506a6c9)\r\n- #801: `EmbedBuilder` will no longer implicitly convert to `Embed`, you must build manually (94f7dd2)\r\n- #804: Command-related tasks will have the 'async' suffix (14fbe40)\r\n- #812: The WebSocket4Net provider has been bumped to version 0.15, allowing support for .NET Standard apps (e25054b)\r\n- #829: DeleteMessagesAsync moved from IMessageChannel to ITextChannel (e00f17f)\r\n- #853: WebSocket will now use `zlib-stream` compression (759db34)\r\n- #874: The `ReadMessages` permission is moving to `ViewChannel` (edfbd05)\r\n- #877: Refactored Games into Activities (34b4e5a)\r\n- `IGuildChannel#Nsfw` moved to `ITextChannel`, now maps to the API property (608bc35)\r\n- Preemptive ratelimits are now logged under verbose, rather than warning.

No code changes need to be made, but dependencies of this method **MUST** be recompiled.\r\n\r\nPer #1294, `EmbedBuilder.WithAuthor` must use the `IUser` overload. Behaviorally, this acts similarly, except that nicknames will not be displayed. Dependencies of this method **MUST** be recompiled.\r\n\r\nPer 03e6401, when a bulk delete event is received, the client will log a warning, and raise the `MessageDeleted` event for all messages in the bulk delete, as well as the `MessagesBulkDeleted` event. To suppress this warning, the client should be configured with the `ExclusiveBulkDelete` set.\r\n```cs\r\nvar client = new DiscordSocketClient(new DiscordSocketConfig {\r\n    ExclusiveBulkDelete = false // raise both events\r\n    // OR\r\n    ExclusiveBulkDelete = true // raise only MessagesBulkDeleted\r\n});\r\n``` \r\n\r\n### Added\r\n- #1236: Bulk deletes (for messages) may now be accessed via the `MessagesBulkDeleted` event (dec353e)\r\n- #1240: OAuth applications utilizing the `guilds.join` scope may now add users to guilds through any client (1356ea9)\r\n- #1255: Message and attachment spoilers may now be set or detected (f3b20b2)\r\n- #1260: DiscordWebhookClient may be created from a Webhook URL (f2113c7)\r\n- #1261: A `GetCategoryChannel` helper may now be used to retrieve category channels directly from socket guilds (e03c527)\r\n- #1263: \"user joined the guild\" messages are now supported (00d3f5a)\r\n- #1271: AuthorID may now be retrieved from message delete audit log entries (1ae4220)\r\n- #1293: News Channels are now supported 📰 (9084c42)\r\n- `ExclusiveBulkDelete` configuration setting can be used to control bulk delete event behavior (03e6401)\r\n\r\n### Removed\r\n- #1294: The `IGuildUser` overload of `EmbedBuilder.WithAuthor` no longer exists (b52b54d)\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n- #1256: Fetching audit logs no longer raises null reference exceptions when a webhook has been deleted (049b014) \r\n- #1268: Null reference exceptions on `MESSAGE_CREATE` concerning partial member objects no longer occur (377622b)\r\n- #1278: The token validator now internally pads tokens to the proper length (48b327b)\r\n- #1292: Messages now properly initialize empty collections (b2ebc03)\r\n- The `DiscordSocketRestClient` is now properly initialized (a44c13a)\r\n- Exceptions in event handlers are now always logged (f6e3200)\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n- #1305: Token validation will fail when tokens contain whitespace (bb61efa)\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n- #1241: Added documentation samples for Webhooks (655a006)\r\n- #1243: Happy new year 🎉 (0275f7d)\r\n- #1257: Improved clarity in comments in the command samples (2473619)\r\n- #1276: Documentation uses a relative path for the logo asset (b80f0e8)\r\n- #1303: EmbedBuilder documentation now builds in the correct spot (51618e6)\r\n- #1304: Updated documentation (4309550)\r\n- CI for this project is now powered by Azure DevOps (this is not a sponsored message 🚀) (9b2bc18)\r\n- IDisposableAnalyzers should now be a development dependency (8003ac8)",

For unicode emojis, you should use the `Emoji` class; for guild emotes, either parse the emote via `Emote.Parse` or fetch it from the guild.\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nIEmote emote = new Emoji(\"\\U0001f603\");\r\n// or:\r\nIEmote emote = Emote.Parse(\"<:fox_moose:381914721642872843>\");\r\n\r\nvar reactions = await msg.GetReactionUsersAsync(emote);\r\n```\r\n\r\nPer #744, IAsyncEnumerable can be flattened into a single, non-paginated Async collection via `IAsyncEnumerable#Flatten`, or can be flattened into a single IEnumerable via `FlattenAsync`. All existing code should be moved from `await coll.Flatten();` -> `await coll.FlattenAsync();`\r\n\r\nPer #790, `EmbedBuilder.AddInlineField` has been removed. You should instead use `AddField(inline: true)`\r\n\r\nPer #801, all EmbedBuilders must be built prior to use in a message. All existing code should append the build method: `await ReplyAsync(\"\", embed: embed`**`.Build()`**`)`\r\n\r\nPer #804, the overridden signatures of your commands attributes will need to be refactored:\r\n- `PreconditionAttribute#CheckPermissions` -> `PreconditionAttribute#CheckPermissionsAsync`\r\n- `TypeReader#Read` -> `TypeReader#ReadAsync`\r\n\r\nPer #829, you will need to ensure that you are in an `ITextChannel` when attempting to bulk delete or access the NSFW property:\r\n```cs\r\nif (channel is ITextChannel text)\r\n{\r\n    await text.DeleteMessagesAsync();\r\n    var nsfw = text.Nsfw;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPer #874, you should replace all accesses to `(Guild|Channel)Permission.ReadMessages` with `ViewChannel`\r\n\r\nPer #877, Games have been refactored and made more polymorphic.\r\n- `IGuildUser#Game` -> `IGuildUser#Activity`\r\n- `StreamType` -> `ActivityType`\r\n- `StreamType.NotStreaming` -> `ActivityType.Playing`\r\n- `StreamType.Twitch` -> `ActivityType.Streaming`\r\n- Activities only include the name of the game and the ActivityType.\r\n- Activities are a type of `Game`, `StreamingGame`, or `RichGame` - you may want to use a pattern match.\r\n\r\nPer #955, the `GameParty` class now uses `long` instead of `int`. Update your domain objects accordingly, if you need to.\r\n\r\nPer #958, **user tokens are no longer supported**. Discord disallows and discourages their usage, so we suggest you bring your selfbot-based projects to an end, or find another Discord library which still supports user token login.\r\n\r\nPer #1033, references to `ReadMessages` should be changed to `ViewChannel`. This applies to the guild and channel permissions enums, as well as the permissions sets.\r\n\t\r\nPer #1057, `IAudioChannel#ConnectAsync` was changed from one parameter to three parameters.\r\n\r\nPer #1164, the `CommandExecuted` event has changed signature. You may need to update your event handlers.\r\n\r\nPer #1171, all client types now implement `IDisposable`. You may need to update your own objects to match this change.\r\n\r\nPer #1172, invite related methods were moved from `IGuildChannel` to `INestedChannel`. You may need to replace these channel accesses with casts to nested channels first.\r\n\r\nPer #1196, `CreateCategoryAsync` now takes a properties function before the request options. If you were specifying request options without using a named parameter before, this will need to be updated.\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n- #747: `CommandService` now has a `CommandExecuted` event

No code changes need to be made, but dependencies of this method **MUST** be recompiled.\r\n\r\nPer #1294, `EmbedBuilder.WithAuthor` must use the `IUser` overload. Behaviorally, this acts similarly, except that nicknames will not be displayed. Dependencies of this method **MUST** be recompiled.\r\n\r\nPer 03e6401, when a bulk delete event is received, the client will log a warning, and raise the `MessageDeleted` event for all messages in the bulk delete, as well as the `MessagesBulkDeleted` event. To suppress this warning, the client should be configured with the `ExclusiveBulkDelete` set.\r\n```cs\r\nvar client = new DiscordSocketClient(new DiscordSocketConfig {\r\n    ExclusiveBulkDelete = false // raise both events\r\n    // OR\r\n    ExclusiveBulkDelete = true // raise only MessagesBulkDeleted\r\n});\r\n``` \r\n\r\n### Added\r\n- #1236: Bulk deletes (for messages) may now be accessed via the `MessagesBulkDeleted` event (dec353e)\r\n- #1240: OAuth applications utilizing the `guilds.join` scope may now add users to guilds through any client (1356ea9)\r\n- #1255: Message and attachment spoilers may now be set or detected (f3b20b2)\r\n- #1260: DiscordWebhookClient may be created from a Webhook URL (f2113c7)\r\n- #1261: A `GetCategoryChannel` helper may now be used to retrieve category channels directly from socket guilds (e03c527)\r\n- #1263: \"user joined the guild\" messages are now supported (00d3f5a)\r\n- #1271: AuthorID may now be retrieved from message delete audit log entries (1ae4220)\r\n- #1293: News Channels are now supported 📰 (9084c42)\r\n- `ExclusiveBulkDelete` configuration setting can be used to control bulk delete event behavior (03e6401)\r\n\r\n### Removed\r\n- #1294: The `IGuildUser` overload of `EmbedBuilder.WithAuthor` no longer exists (b52b54d)\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n- #1256: Fetching audit logs no longer raises null reference exceptions when a webhook has been deleted (049b014) \r\n- #1268: Null reference exceptions on `MESSAGE_CREATE` concerning partial member objects no longer occur (377622b)\r\n- #1278: The token validator now internally pads tokens to the proper length (48b327b)\r\n- #1292: Messages now properly initialize empty collections (b2ebc03)\r\n- The `DiscordSocketRestClient` is now properly initialized (a44c13a)\r\n- Exceptions in event handlers are now always logged (f6e3200)\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n- #1305: Token validation will fail when tokens contain whitespace (bb61efa)\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n- #1241: Added documentation samples for Webhooks (655a006)\r\n- #1243: Happy new year 🎉 (0275f7d)\r\n- #1257: Improved clarity in comments in the command samples (2473619)\r\n- #1276: Documentation uses a relative path for the logo asset (b80f0e8)\r\n- #1303: EmbedBuilder documentation now builds in the correct spot (51618e6)\r\n- #1304: Updated documentation (4309550)\r\n- CI for this project is now powered by Azure DevOps (this is not a sponsored message 🚀) (9b2bc18)\r\n- IDisposableAnalyzers should now be a development dependency (8003ac8)",

For unicode emojis, you should use the `Emoji` class; for guild emotes, either parse the emote via `Emote.Parse` or fetch it from the guild.\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nIEmote emote = new Emoji(\"\\U0001f603\");\r\n// or:\r\nIEmote emote = Emote.Parse(\"<:fox_moose:381914721642872843>\");\r\n\r\nvar reactions = await msg.GetReactionUsersAsync(emote);\r\n```\r\n\r\nPer #744, IAsyncEnumerable can be flattened into a single, non-paginated Async collection via `IAsyncEnumerable#Flatten`, or can be flattened into a single IEnumerable via `FlattenAsync`. All existing code should be moved from `await coll.Flatten();` -> `await coll.FlattenAsync();`\r\n\r\nPer #790, `EmbedBuilder.AddInlineField` has been removed. You should instead use `AddField(inline: true)`\r\n\r\nPer #801, all EmbedBuilders must be built prior to use in a message. All existing code should append the build method: `await ReplyAsync(\"\", embed: embed`**`.Build()`**`)`\r\n\r\nPer #804, the overridden signatures of your commands attributes will need to be refactored:\r\n- `PreconditionAttribute#CheckPermissions` -> `PreconditionAttribute#CheckPermissionsAsync`\r\n- `TypeReader#Read` -> `TypeReader#ReadAsync`\r\n\r\nPer #829, you will need to ensure that you are in an `ITextChannel` when attempting to bulk delete or access the NSFW property:\r\n```cs\r\nif (channel is ITextChannel text)\r\n{\r\n    await text.DeleteMessagesAsync();\r\n    var nsfw = text.Nsfw;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPer #874, you should replace all accesses to `(Guild|Channel)Permission.ReadMessages` with `ViewChannel`\r\n\r\nPer #877, Games have been refactored and made more polymorphic.\r\n- `IGuildUser#Game` -> `IGuildUser#Activity`\r\n- `StreamType` -> `ActivityType`\r\n- `StreamType.NotStreaming` -> `ActivityType.Playing`\r\n- `StreamType.Twitch` -> `ActivityType.Streaming`\r\n- Activities only include the name of the game and the ActivityType.\r\n- Activities are a type of `Game`, `StreamingGame`, or `RichGame` - you may want to use a pattern match.\r\n\r\nPer #955, the `GameParty` class now uses `long` instead of `int`. Update your domain objects accordingly, if you need to.\r\n\r\nPer #958, **user tokens are no longer supported**. Discord disallows and discourages their usage, so we suggest you bring your selfbot-based projects to an end, or find another Discord library which still supports user token login.\r\n\r\nPer #1033, references to `ReadMessages` should be changed to `ViewChannel`. This applies to the guild and channel permissions enums, as well as the permissions sets.\r\n\t\r\nPer #1057, `IAudioChannel#ConnectAsync` was changed from one parameter to three parameters.\r\n\r\nPer #1164, the `CommandExecuted` event has changed signature. You may need to update your event handlers.\r\n\r\nPer #1171, all client types now implement `IDisposable`. You may need to update your own objects to match this change.\r\n\r\nPer #1172, invite related methods were moved from `IGuildChannel` to `INestedChannel`. You may need to replace these channel accesses with casts to nested channels first.\r\n\r\nPer #1196, `CreateCategoryAsync` now takes a properties function before the request options. If you were specifying request options without using a named parameter before, this will need to be updated.\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n- #747: `CommandService` now has a `CommandExecuted` event (e991715)\r\n- #765: Parameters may have a name specified via `NameAttribute` (9c81ab9)\r\n- #773: Both socket clients inherit from `BaseSocketClient` (9b7afec)\r\n- #785: Primitives now automatically

        "changelog": "This is a beta release of the next major version. Changes have been made to fix previous design errors, as well as add additional functionality per the Discord API. \r\n\r\nThanks to the following for their contributions this release:\r\n\r\n- @alanschapira \r\n- @AntiTcb \r\n- @BinkanSalaryman \r\n- @Chris-Johnston \r\n- @Emzi0767 \r\n- @enzosk8 \r\n- @FiniteReality \r\n- @Izumemori \r\n- @Joe4evr \r\n- @MarkusGordathian \r\n- @ObsidianMinor \r\n- @Still34 \r\n- @SubZero0 \r\n- @vim2meta \r\n- @Vollrat \r\n\r\n### Upgrade Path\r\n\r\nPer #731, a correct implementation of `IEmote` must be used when accessing reaction users. For unicode emojis, you should use the `Emoji` class; for guild emotes, either parse the emote via `Emote.Parse` or fetch it from the guild.\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nIEmote emote = new Emoji(\"\\U0001f603\");\r\n// or:\r\nIEmote emote = Emote.Parse(\"<:fox_moose:381914721642872843>\");\r\n\r\nvar reactions = await msg.GetReactionUsersAsync(emote);\r\n```\r\n\r\nPer #744, IAsyncEnumerable can be flattened into a single, non-paginated Async collection via `IAsyncEnumerable#Flatten`, or can be flattened into a single IEnumerable via `FlattenAsync`. All existing code should be moved from `await coll.Flatten();` -> `await coll.FlattenAsync();`\r\n\r\nPer #790, `EmbedBuilder.AddInlineField` has been removed. You should instead use `AddField(inline: true)`\r\n\r\nPer #801, all EmbedBuilders must be built prior to use in a message. All existing code should append the build method: `await ReplyAsync(\"\", embed: embed`**`.Build()`**`)`\r\n\r\nPer #804, the overridden signatures of your commands attributes will need to be refactored:\r\n- `PreconditionAttribute#CheckPermissions` -> `PreconditionAttribute#CheckPermissionsAsync`\r\n- `TypeReader#Read` -> `TypeReader#ReadAsync`\r\n\r\nPer #829, you will need to ensure that you are in an `ITextChannel` when attempting to bulk delete or access the NSFW property:\r\n```cs\r\nif (channel is ITextChannel text)\r\n{\r\n    await text.DeleteMessagesAsync();\r\n    var nsfw = text.Nsfw;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPer #874, you should replace all accesses to `(Guild|Channel)Permission.ReadMessages` with `ViewChannel`\r\n\r\nPer #877, Games have been refactored and made more polymorphic.\r\n- `IGuildUser#Game` -> `IGuildUser#Activity`\r\n- `StreamType` -> `ActivityType`\r\n- `StreamType.NotStreaming` -> `ActivityType.Playing`\r\n- `StreamType.Twitch` -> `ActivityType.Streaming`\r\n- Activities only include the name of the game and the ActivityType.\r\n- Activities are a type of `Game`, `StreamingGame`, or `RichGame` - you may want to use a pattern match.\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\n- #747: `CommandService` now has a `CommandExecuted` event (e991715)\r\n- #765: Parameters may have a name specified via `NameAttribute` (9c81ab9)\r\n- #773: Both socket clients inherit from `BaseSocketClient` (9b7afec)\r\n- #785: Primitives now automatically load a NullableTypeReader (cb0ff78)\r\n- #819: Support for Welcome Message channels (30e867a)\r\n- #835: Emoji may now be managed from a bot (b4bf046)\r\n- #843: Webhooks may now be managed from a bot (7b2ddd0)\r\n- #863: An embed may be converted to an `EmbedBuilder` using the `.ToEmbedBuilder()` method (5218e6b)\r\n- #877: Support for reading rich presences (34b4e5a)\r\n- #888: Users may now opt-in to using a proxy (678a723)\r\n- #906: API Analyzers to assist users when writing their bot (f69ef2a)\r\n- #907: Full support for channel categories (030422f)\r\n- #913: Animated emoji may be read and written (a19ff18)\r\n- #915: Unused parameters may be discarded, rather than failing the command (5f46aef)\r\n- #929: Standard EqualityComparers for use in LINQ operations with the library's entities (b5e7548)\r\n- 'html' variant added to the `EmbedType` enum (42c879c)\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n- #742: `DiscordShardedClient#GetGuildFor` will now direct null guilds to Shard 0 (d5e9d6f)\r\n- #743: Various issues with permissions and inheritance of permissions (f996338)\r\n- #755: `IRole.Mention` will correctly tag the @everyone role (6b5a6e7)\r\n- #768: `CreateGuildAsync` will include the icon stream (865080a)\r\n- #866: Revised permissions constants and behavior (dec7cb2)\r\n- #872: Bulk message deletion should no longer fail for incomplete batch sizes (804d918)\r\n- #923: A null value should properly reset a user's nickname (227f61a)\r\n- #938: The reconnect handler should no longer deadlock during Discord outages (73ac9d7)\r\n- Ignore messages with no ID in bulk delete (676be40)\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n- #731: `IUserMessage#GetReactionUsersAsync` now takes an `IEmote` instead of a `string` (5d7f2fc)\r\n- #744: IAsyncEnumerable has been redesigned (5bbd9bb)\r\n- #777: `IGuild#DefaultChannel` will now resolve the first accessible channel, per changes to Discord (1ffcd4b)\r\n- #781: Attempting to add or remove a member's EveryoneRole will throw (506a6c9)\r\n- #801: `EmbedBuilder` will no longer implicitly convert to `Embed`, you must build manually (94f7dd2)\r\n- #804: Command-related tasks will have the 'async' suffix (14fbe40)\r\n- #812: The WebSocket4Net provider has been bumped to version 0.15, allowing support for .NET Standard apps (e25054b)\r\n- #829: DeleteMessagesAsync moved from IMessageChannel to ITextChannel (e00f17f)\r\n- #853: WebSocket will now use `zlib-stream` compression (759db34)\r\n- #874: The `ReadMessages` permission is moving to `ViewChannel` (edfbd05)\r\n- #877: Refactored Games into Activities (34b4e5a)\r\n- `IGuildChannel#Nsfw` moved to `ITextChannel`, now maps to the API property (608bc35)\r\n- Preemptive ratelimits are now logged under verbose, rather than warning.

(#5)\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nWith OSCQuery being added, this mod now requires two different dependencies. \r\n\r\n- Download and move `vrc-oscquery-lib.dll` and `MeaMod.DNS.dll` to `rml_libs` folder, you find it where resonite is installed.\r\n- Download and move `VRCFTReceiver.dll` to `rml_mods` folder.\r\n- Install [VRCFaceTracking v5.2.3](https://github.com/benaclejames/VRCFaceTracking/releases/tag/5.2.3.0) if you don't have it already.\r\n- Open VRCFT (with your preferred module installed) and Resonite and it should just work. In case, it doesn't try changing receiving port in the mod and the sending port on VRCFT (for example 9003)\r\n\r\nThis is a release candidate, if you find any issues or want to give feedback, either use [this thread](https://canary.discord.com/channels/901126079857692714/1267910572880429068) in [FrooxEngine Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/vCDJK9xyvm) or [open a issue](https://github.com/hazre/VRCFTReceiver/issues/new).",

        "changelog": "# IMPORTANT INFO\r\n\r\nIn our current runtime (Unity mono 5.11), CherryPick seems to exacerbate certain innocuous usages of reflection, causing slowdowns in seemingly unrelated parts of the game due to the fact that it needs to look up all valid FrooxEngine component names via methods that use reflection.\r\n\r\nIt is **highly** recommended (though not required) that you also grab [Effortless Efficiency](https://github.com/BlueCyro/EffortlessEfficiency/releases/tag/1.0.0) to install alongside CherryPick, as it will alleviate some issues with the runtime such as Animator components hitching when switching their clips. Install Effortless Efficiency if you experience any weird performance issues.\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nWith that out of the way, I've optimized the search method for CherryPick by de-LinQ-ifying much of the search loop. Searching should be far more performant. I've also changed the method by which the component list is looked up and cached, which should solve the slowdowns in other parts of the game too (contacts list, inventory, some other stuff that utilizes reflection, etc.) and so your games should feel much snappier.\r\n\r\nI strive to make my mods as non-invasive and as light as possible, so I deeply apologize if you've been noticing performance slowdowns with my mod installed. Seeing the popularity CherryPick has gained warms my heart, and so hopefully these few things make up for that. ❤️\r\n\r\n# Changelog\r\n\r\n- Improved search method speed significantly by removing LinQ from hot parts of the search code\r\n    - The searching should be more efficient and feel snappier overall\r\n- Changed method for building the component cache, avoiding significant slowdowns in other parts of the engine - solves issue #17 \r\n- Provided link to [Effortless Efficiency](https://github.com/BlueCyro/EffortlessEfficiency/releases/tag/1.0.0) - solves issue #10\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",

        "changelog": "**Hello Modders!**\r\n\r\nThis is the 2nd major release for Harmony. The API has become more mature and this release contains a few important bug fixes. There are a lot of changes:\r\n\r\n**# Harmony now supports methods with try/catch logic**\r\n\r\nThis is a big one. CodeInstructions for transpilers now carry a new field 'blocks' that is a list over different enum values that reflect start and end points for exception blocks. If you copy existing instructions around you should use the new Clone() method or empty that field manually.\r\n\r\nA mixture of old and new Harmony versions can co-exist because the new Harmony has a self-patching feature that updates selected parts of itself (in this case the transpiler pipeline). There is also a preserving function that makes sure that old CodeInstructions don't lead to information loss.\r\n\r\n**# Improved AccessTools**\r\n\r\nThere are now more ways to get your MethodInfo's - for declared methods and for private types. Have a look and don't use ordinary reflections.\r\n\r\n**# Patching improvements**\r\n\r\nYou can now unpatch and there are new ways to mass patch a whole class. Also, Prepare and TargetMethod have been improved.\r\n\r\nPostfixes now support a pipe-through function so you can change results that cannot be changed by `ref` (IEnumerable i.e.). Error reporting has been improved and is faster.\r\n\r\nPrivate fields of the current instance/class can now be injected in your prefixes/postfixes by using their name prefixed with three underscores. It is also possible to annotate argument name translations for obfuscated methods.\r\n\r\n**# Misc**\r\n\r\nTons of other stuff has changed and the documentation will be updated soon. Compatibility with .NET has been improved and you can extract IL code from other methods for usage in your transpilers. AccessCache had a bug fixed where it would cache types wrongly. And lots more...\r\n\r\nPlease consult the Wiki to learn more about how to use Harmony.\r\n\r\nThanks again to all the friendly people from the different gaming and modding communities. Without you, we would not have come this far.\r\n\r\nAndreas Pardeike",
